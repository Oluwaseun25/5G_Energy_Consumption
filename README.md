# 5G Energy Consumption Modeling

## Introduction

This project involves working with the '5G-Energy Consumption' dataset provided by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2023 as part of a global challenge for data scientists. The competition runs from July 5, 2023, to September 30, 2023. The goal is to build and train a machine learning model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations (BSs), considering the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.

## Problem Statement

Network operational expenditure (OPEX) already accounts for around 25 percent of the total telecom operatorâ€™s cost, and 90 percent of it is spent on large energy bills. More than 70 percent of this energy is estimated to be consumed by the radio access network (RAN), particularly by the base stations (BSs). Thus, the objective is to develop a machine learning model to estimate the energy consumption of 5G base stations, taking into account different engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.

## Objectives

1. **Estimate Energy Consumption**: Develop a machine learning model to accurately estimate the energy consumed by 5G base stations.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various features related to the operation of 5G base stations, such as:

1. **Base Station ID**: Unique identifier for each base station.
2. **Configuration Parameters**: Various engineering configurations for the base stations.
3. **Traffic Conditions**: Data on traffic load and patterns.
4. **Energy-Saving Methods**: Information on implemented energy-saving methods.
5. **Energy Consumption**: Measured energy consumption for the base stations.

## Tools and Libraries

This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning modeling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you'll need to have Python installed. You can then install the necessary libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/5g-energy-consumption.git
cd 5g-energy-consumption
```

2. **Run the analysis script:**

The main analysis and modeling are contained in the `analysis.py` script. You can run this script to perform the data analysis and train the machine learning model:

```sh
python analysis.py
```

## Analysis and Recommendations

### Model Development

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to select the best-performing model.
- **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set.
